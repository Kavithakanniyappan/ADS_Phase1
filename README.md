Air Analysis and Prediction Program

 Introduction

This program is designed to analyze air quality data and provide predictions for Tamil Nadu. It utilizes historical air quality data to make forecasts and offers insights into air pollution levels.

 Prerequisites

 Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for data visualization)
 Required Python libraries (you can install them using `pip`):
  numpy
   pandas
   matplotlib (for data visualization)
   scikit-learn (for machine learning)

 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-analysis-tamilnadu.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd air-analysis-tamilnadu
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

 Usage

1. Data Collection:
   Ensure you have the necessary historical air quality data in a CSV format. You can obtain this data from [source].

2. Data Preprocessing:
    Place the CSV file in the `data/` directory.
    Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for analysis:
     ```
     python data_preprocessing.py
     

3. Data Analysis and Prediction:
    Open the Jupyter Notebook (recommended) or use the provided Python scripts in the `analysis/` directory to perform data analysis and prediction.

4. Visualize Results (Optional):
    If using Jupyter Notebook, visualize the results using the provided code.

5. Interpret Results:
   Analyze the output to understand air quality trends and predictions for Tamil Nadu.

6. Modify and Customize:
   Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs or improve the analysis.
